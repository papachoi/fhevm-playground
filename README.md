# fhevm-playground

Tiny experiments around **FHEVM** concepts. Start simple; iterate daily.

## Today
- [x] Init repo
- [x] Add minimal Solidity contract (placeholder)
- [ ] Write day1 notes in `notes/day1.md`

## Idea
- Start with a standard counter contract
- Later: evolve into a confidential pattern (e.g., select-based guard)
